To win this game, you need to pair all the card as lower move as possible to get higher ratings.



## Code Dependencies
The app is built with the following code dependencies:
- jquery.js - A javascript library is using in app.js to simplify the selector of HTML. 
- animate.css - An animation CSS library that helps to save the time on developing a animation from scratch. I use the bounce animation from here when open the card. Noted: The reason I'm using this library is because There are tons of very cool animation here. It would be great to add new feature for player choose their own animation when opening the card.
